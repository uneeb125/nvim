# Project Overview

This directory contains a personal Neovim configuration written in Lua. It is managed using the `lazy.nvim` plugin manager, which handles the loading and installation of various plugins. The configuration is structured to be modular, with separate files for general settings, keymaps, and individual plugin configurations. It includes a full development environment for LaTeX.

This setup is based on a "Neovim from Scratch" series, indicating an incremental and well-documented approach to building the configuration.

## Building and Running

This is a Neovim configuration, so there is no traditional "build" process.

*   **Running:** Simply launch Neovim (`nvim`) in your terminal. The configuration will be loaded automatically from this directory (`~/.config/nvim`).
*   **Plugin Management:** The `lazy.nvim` plugin manager handles all aspects of installing, updating, and loading plugins.
    *   Plugins are automatically installed on the first run.
    *   You can manage plugins by running the `:Lazy` command inside Neovim.
*   **LSP & Tools:** Language servers and other tools (like formatters and linters) are managed by `mason.nvim`. They are configured to be installed automatically when a relevant file type is opened, thanks to the `mason-tool-installer.nvim` plugin.
*   **LaTeX Compilation:** Use the `,ll` keymap within a `.tex` file to compile the document and view it in Zathura.

## Development Conventions

The configuration follows a clear and modular structure:

*   **`init.lua`**: The main entry point. It sets up the environment and bootstraps the `lazy.nvim` plugin manager.
*   **`lua/config/`**: This directory contains the core configuration files:
    *   `lazy.lua`: Configures `lazy.nvim`, sets performance options, and specifies where to find plugin definitions.
    *   `options.lua`: Sets general Neovim options (`vim.opt`), covering UI, text editing, search behavior, and more.
    *   `keymaps.lua`: Defines global and plugin-specific keybindings.
*   **`lua/plugins/`**: Each file in this directory defines a plugin specification for `lazy.nvim`. The file returns a Lua table that `lazy.nvim` uses to load and configure the plugin. This keeps the setup clean and allows for easy enabling or disabling of plugins.
*   **`lazy-lock.json`**: This file is automatically generated by `lazy.nvim` to lock plugin versions, ensuring a reproducible and stable configuration.

Key plugins in use include:
*   **`vimtex`**: A comprehensive plugin for editing LaTeX documents, providing compilation, navigation, and more.
*   **`nvim-treesitter`**: For advanced syntax highlighting, indentation, and text objects.
*   **`nvim-lspconfig`**, **`mason.nvim`**: For IDE-like features through the Language Server Protocol. `texlab` is used for LaTeX support.
*   **`conform.nvim`**: For automatic code formatting.
*   **`fzf-lua`**: For fast, fuzzy-finding of files, buffers, and more.
*   **`oil.nvim`**: A file explorer that replaces `netrw`.
*   **`mini.statusline`**: A minimal and fast status line.
